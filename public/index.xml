The chapter is provided in GauchoSpace and is a useful resource if you need more information on how to clean and screen your data and write up the results.</description>

      <title>Introduction to R, Mplus, and MplusAutomation</title>

      <description>Please note that this document walks through AppStream which provides to access Mplus at UC Santa Barbara. If you already own Mplus, then you can ignore that part (i.e., you do not need to link your Google Drive to AppStream).
For Part 1, we will first walk through how to run basic descriptive statistics using only Mplus. Then in the in the second part, we will use an R package called MplusAutomation to run the same analysis as part 1, only this time using only RStudio.</description>

Simple Linear Regression The Equation The equation of simple linear regression is this:
$$Y_i = \alpha + \beta{x}_i + \epsilon_i $$ Expressed as Betas:
$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta{x}_i + \epsilon_i $$
When we are predicting Y, we express the prediction equation as this:</description>

- Also called moderation
Example: The relationship between discrimination and grades depends on prog.
Graph drawn using draw.io.
Moderation Example Suppose you are doing a simple study on weight loss and notice that people who spend more time exercising lose more weight.</description>

      <description>Background The U.S. presidential election in 2012 did not come as a surprise. Some correctly predicted the outcome of the election correctly including Nate Silver, and many speculated about his approach.
Despite the success in 2012, the 2016 presidential election came as a big surprise to many, and it underscored that predicting voter behavior is complicated for many reasons despite the tremendous effort in collecting, analyzing, and understanding many available datasets.</description>

      <description>As with color themes, you can completely customize your site&amp;rsquo;s fonts within minutes of creating a new site. How you do it depends on how much control and customization you need.
Embedded fonts Hugo Apéro includes 6 embedded fonts that work &amp;ldquo;out of the box.&amp;rdquo; We selected 3 serif and 3 sans-serif options that we thought looked good with this theme, in our humble opinions. All embedded fonts include real italics so you may emphasize to your heart&amp;rsquo;s content ❤️!</description>

      <description>Rendering mathematical equations Examples from the mathjax demo. But they work with katex as well.
Rmarkdown In .Rmarkdown documents, you can use either
$a \ne 0$ to get inline math: \(a \ne 0\). There is no conflict with using dollar symbols regularly, because knitr automatically escapes freestanding dollar symbols.
And you can use
$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$ to get a math paragraph:
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.</description>

      <description>Courtesy of panelset.js by Garrick Aden-Buie, from his xaringanExtra package: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/panelset
For example, this panelset:
Hello! 👋 hello
Goodbye 💨 goodbye
Was created by combining this theme&amp;rsquo;s panelset and panel shortcodes:
{{&amp;lt; panelset class=&amp;#34;greetings&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; panel name=&amp;#34;Hello! :wave:&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}} hello {{&amp;lt; /panel &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; panel name=&amp;#34;Goodbye :dash:&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}} goodbye {{&amp;lt; /panel &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; /panelset &amp;gt;}} You could also revert to HTML as well. For example, this panelset:

      <description>Tachyons is a design system that allows you to design gorgeous interfaces in the browser with little effort. Because Speed Building this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic (or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons. It&amp;rsquo;s a design system that provides very small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML. So, rather than writing every line of CSS, you apply the style you need as you write your HTML with easy to understand shorthand class names.</description>

Desirée De Leon 🦒 (designed 5 of the custom color themes, made illustrations for the workshop, and provided general aesthetic feedback along the way)
Garrick Aden-Buie 🧙‍♀️ (debugged headroom.js and lent his panelset.js code to the theme)
Allison Horst 🐕 (awesome illustrations of campfires, seedlings, and evergreens, as well as my R Markdown hedgehog mascot 🦔)</description>
